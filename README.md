# PacMen-Factory

how to run code: 
1. go to the starting page of the repository 
2. click "Code" 
3. select "Download ZIP"
4. right click ZIP file and choose to extract the ZIP (name of option may vary depending on software used to extract)
5. open the "Index.html" file with your browser (tested with google chrome, if it doesn't work with your default, try using chrome)

IMPORTANT: do not separate the items from their folders AS IS, as the HTML file uses the Javascript file, and the Javascript relies on the images being in their shared "images" folder!

possible future improvements: 
1. fix issue where if a PacMan spawns on the start button before the PacMen start moving, you can't click the button behind the PacMan (unless there is a large enough opening)
2. add button to slow/stop PacMen moving (similar to the start/speed up button)
3. add button to remove/clear PacMen
4. separate "start" and "speed up" buttons (or have text on button update accordingly)
5. do the same for "slow" and "stop" buttons (same alternative)
